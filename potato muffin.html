    <h1>Potato Muffin</h1>
    <p>
        Sweet potato purée and banana bind the ingredients of these vegan muffins together (so you can skip the eggs), while adding a natural sweetness to the batter. Studded with juicy dates and rolled oats, these muffins are perfect as a snack when you’re on the go or as a light breakfast. Add the optional orange zest and pecans for even more flavor and texture.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        Makes 12 Muffins
        <h3>Dry Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup / 150g whole-grain wheat flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1 cup / 100g rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 cup / 150g chopped dates</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Wet Ingredients:</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup / 60ml coconut oil, melted, plus more for greasing the muffin tin</li>
            <li>2 ripe bananas</li>
            <li>1 cup / 275g sweet potato purée (from about 1 large roasted sweet potato)</li>
            <li>¹⁄8 cup / 80ml pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¾ cup / 185ml plant-based milk of your choice</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Optional:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Handful of chopped raw, unsalted pecans</li>
            <li>Zest of 1 orange</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        Preheat the oven to 375°C / 190°C. Lightly grease a 12-muffin tin with coconut oil and set it aside.

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, and salt. Add the oats and stir to combine.

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        In a food processor, pulse to combine the bananas, sweet potato purée, maple syrup, coconut oil, vanilla, and milk. Pour these wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and stir to combine, using as few strokes as possible. Fold in the chopped dates and optional add-ins.

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        Drop a few tablespoons of the batter into each muffin cup and bake until they are golden, fragrant, and pass the toothpick test, about 30 minutes. Store leftover muffins in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for 1 month.
